# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Tweet to your heart's delight - but make sure your tweet is 140 characters long or shorter or the app may not be happy with you! If you get lost down the app reading tweets, a scroll-up button will be there to help you back up as well. Tweeter works well on mobile and desktop!

Provides a demonstration of HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express back-end skills.
